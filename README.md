# HVAC-Anomaly-Detection-Model
This model was created with a combination of two models, LSTM and Autoencoders. Assuming the dataset contains normal HVAC activity data, and the model is trained to recognize normal HVAC activity data and activities with values above or below the normal limits will be considered as anomalies.
