# HVAC-Anomaly-Detection-Model
The first model was created with Autoencoders(Unsupervised), and the second one created using Random Forest(Supervised). The dataset contains labeled data of both normal and anomalies of HVAC activity, and the model is trained for multi-class classification to classified each type of anomaly conditions and normal condition based on the parameter of the HVAC activity.
